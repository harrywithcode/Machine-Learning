# Machine-Learning
There are two projects in two branch, in the aspect of machine learning.

The projects are written by java, to make packages(decision tree, KNN).
In decision tree package, I mainly responsible for ID3 algorithm, how to calculate information gain and choose the best attribute.
In KNN package, I responsible for the total package, it can handle numeric data and text data, to find the closest items.

Based on copyright, some parts of these projects are made by my teammate Gonsoo Moon. I can only upload what I do in this project.
